                            As the custodians of livestock, we never compromise on quality, safety, and prompt delivery of our animals and grains.
                            Our animals are provided with healthy grass and sustainably sourced wasted grain produced from our farm.
                            Our products are butchered, cleaned and transported to all areas in Nigeria's South West region and other geopolitical zones. We sell wholesale, retail, and segmented livestock as our customer satisfaction is our No. 1 Priority.
